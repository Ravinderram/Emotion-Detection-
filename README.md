# Emotion-Detection

This project focuses on detecting human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. The system is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.

The application can be used in various fields, including:

* Customer sentiment analysis
